1 nodeId作用？
在分布式运行中，机器节点标识用于唯一标识每个节点。通过该标识，可以手动指定特定实例在预期的节点上执行。

2 报运行数据格式不匹配错误？
错误主要由于端配置错误，导致数据不匹配。检查实例配置的运行类型（读写/计算）是否配置正确，以及插件引入是否正确。

3 如何多实例往同一个地方写数据？
配置referenceInstance指向一个虚实例任务,虚实例任务（virtualPipe）配置nextJob，由虚任务控制同时写一个地方的子任务启动与它们之间的同步。

4 为何实例自动停止运行？
当实例运行时频繁出现过多高危级别的错误时，实例运行会被挂起，可以通过界面 重置断路器 重新打开运行。

5 如何构建DAG类任务？
. 在配置nextJob参数，多个任务使用逗号分隔，默认将按输入顺序执行任务;
. 注意除了root节点任务，其他任务不需要配置deltaCron、fullCron。

6 vearch资源端的实例如何查询？
- 注：端口为搜索端口，test_vearch为实例名称
. 1）通过id查询：(GET)  http://localhost:[8090]/test_vearch?ids=123,234
. 2）通过特征查询:(POST/application/json)
  http://localhost:[8090]/test_vearch
  {

7 kafka资源端的实例如何查询？
- 注：端口为搜索端口，test_kafka为实例名称
. 1）通过content查询：(GET)  http://localhost:[8090]/test_kafka?content=test

8 配置数据扫描类任务时，扫描的数据有缺失，如何解决？
- 扫描具体页面数据SQL注意 >= '#{start_time}'，防止在某个时间点有多条时，扫描某一页时丢失数据
- 分页SQL要使用 > '#{start_time}'，防止陷入不断重复扫描同一位置。
